My personal set of .dotfiles for bash, Vim and other stuff like precompiled
binaries.

## Setup
You may hand pick the parts you like or simply run the setup script. It will
put everything in place. Next time you open your shell, you'll be amazed. The
setup script will create a backup folder and move existing files to it.
```
git clone https://github.com/WieWaldi/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
./dotfiles/setup.sh
```
