|   This setup script will put WieWaldi's .dotfiles into your home             |
|   directory. Don't be scared to loose any of your personal dotfiles.         |
|   Every file that gets replaced will be backed up.                           |
|                                                                              |
|   However, since this script will copy binaries to ~/.local it may           |
|   happen to replace some of yours. You have been warned.                     |
